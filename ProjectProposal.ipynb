    "The dataset we obtained has fairly clean data, mainly issues with certain columns or rows having a noticeable presence of NaNs. To clean the data, we will drop columns or rows with NaNs, as well as removing certain columns as they are data not relevant to our analysis (e.g. columns \"MarkDown1-5\"). Other columns may need to have their data converted into a different form, e.g. the \"Date\" column as the data type in that column is a string, which is not suitable for data analysis, which we would do by entering a specific argument in pandas.read_csv(dtype=). There will be additional rows to remove as there are more than 45x183 rows of data, meaning some stores have more data than others. To compare stores across each date, additional dates not found in the other stores may need to be removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Data Analysis (1-2 paragraphs)*\n",
    "To analyze the data, linear regression will be performed for each variable of interest against unemployment rate to find correlation coefficients for each of these variables. This will be performed for each store over the period of time that the data covers. This will yield, for each store, R^2 values for each of the variables for that store. These R^2 values can then be compared across stores to see how different regions do or do not have correlations with these variables and unemployment rate. Preliminary analysis of these R^2 values will be done by plotting the R^2 values on a histogram to see the distribution of R^2 values and then the mean and standard deviation of the R^2 values will be taken to determine which variables have the strongest correlations overall. \n",

In this case, the host made no stipulations concerning the outside use or distribution of the dataset itself (only of code relating to the competition during the competition window). Being a Kaggle competition dataset, there is the possibility that the data has biases in how it was taken or selected to fit better the purpose of the competition, or to be selective of Wal-Marts in particular socio-economic areas, meaning that the data could potentially only be generalizable to help people of those specific socio-economic class(es). \n",

If the methods or hypotheses do not produce the anticipated outcomes, it is possible that, even if there is a relationship between the variables and unemployment, it's possible it is not one that can be expressed linearly, in which case we will adapt our methods to work with Polyfit instead of Linear Regression. \n",

It's also possible that the trends may have been true once, but with the rise of e-commerce that the question cannot be fully answered with just an analysis of a physical retail chain. Further on the point of e-commerce, it is also possible that some of the variables are not representing what we think they mean, as there is not a great deal of specification on what each of the variable names on each column represent besides the short description for each on the Kaggle webpage, in addition to the aforementioned potential confounds from the Ethics and Privacy section.
