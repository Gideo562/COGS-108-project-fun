Write standardize function equation

Check for co-linearity
Remove less important factor with more than 0.75 correspondance (too related)
Update equation
Rinse and repeat until no more related (0.75) factors left
sm.OLS time  outcome, predictors = patsy.dmatrices('unemployment ~ [factor1, factor2, etc...]', main_features)
mod = sm.OLS(outcome, prectors)
res = mod.fit()
print(res.summary())

Analysis 2
Standardize data (for each data point, subtract mean and divide by stdr dv)

Word time
Make Jupyter notebook file for final submission

Discuss which features are/aren't relevant and to what degree

Analysis: how much change in weekly sales (or other factors) leads to a change in unemployment
