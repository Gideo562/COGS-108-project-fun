Split the df by store

Analysis time~
(May not end up doing anything on a by-store basis, tbd)
Correlate each of the main factors with unemployment
Determine which factors are relevant in influencing unemployment
Create basic equation relating unemployment to factors
Pair factors up to see how much each factor influences the other
Remove less important factor with more than 0.75 correspondance (too related)
Update equation
Rinse and repeat until no more related (0.75) factors left
sm.OLS time  outcome, predictors = patsy.dmatrices('unemployment ~ [factor1, factor2, etc...]', main_features)
mod = sm.OLS(outcome, prectors)
res = mod.fit()
print(res.summary())
