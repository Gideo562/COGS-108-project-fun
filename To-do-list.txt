Split features into dfs by store (df1, df2, ... df45)
Correlate each of the main factors with unemployment
Determine which factors are relevant in influencing unemployment
Create basic equation relating unemployment to factors
Pair factors up to see how much each factor influences the other
Remove less important factor with more than 0.75 correspondance (too related)
Update equation

Correlate each of the main factors with unemployment
Determine which factors are relevant in influencing unemployment
Create basic equation relating unemployment to factors
Pair factors up to see how much each factor influences the other
Remove less important factor with more than 0.75 correspondance (too related)
Update equation
Rinse and repeat until no more related (0.75) factors left
sm.OLS time  outcome, predictors = patsy.dmatrices('unemployment ~ [factor1, factor2, etc...]', main_features)
mod = sm.OLS(outcome, prectors)
res = mod.fit()
print(res.summary())

Analysis 2
Standardize data (for each data point, subtract mean and divide by stdr dv)

Word time
Make Jupyter notebook file for final submission


Analysis: how much change in weekly sales (or other factors) leads to a change in unemployment
How much is a single job worth?
